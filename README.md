# Doppler-Effect-and-Supersonic-Motions

This package contains animations of the Doppler effects and shock waves. 
All animations are written using javascript and are embedded in the html 
page Doppler.html.

When a wave emitting source is moving, the observed frequency changes. This is known as the 
Doppler effect. Here you will see animations of the Doppler effect for a source moving with 
a constant velocity and in circular motion. The circular motion is interesting and you may 
have seen a demonstration of the resulting Doppler effect from a twirling buzzer. When the 
speed of the motion is faster than the wave speed c, a V-shaped row wave is produced if 
the source is moving with a constant velocity. The shock structure is more complicated in 
circular motion. The mathematical detail and animation setup is explained in the pdf file 
Doppler.pdf in the doc directory.
